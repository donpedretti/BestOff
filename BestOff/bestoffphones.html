                <h3 class="card-title" align="left"><b>1. Samsung Galaxy S10+</b></h3>
                <p class="card-text" align="left">Simply
                    put, this is the fastest, most feature-packed and refined Galaxy smartphone Samsung has ever built. The Galaxy S10 Plus is the first handset to employ its all-new Infinity-O design with an AMOLED panel. And what an AMOLED panel it
                    is! The screen is staggeringly good, with gorgeous colours and cavernous blacks. <br>The Infinity-O design, which relocates the front-facing camera to a pill-shaped cut-out in the top right-hand corner of the display, has allowed Samsung
                    to fit the S10 Plus with an expansive 6.4-inch AMOLED panel – that's the same size as the Galaxy Note 9 – while simultaneously shrinking the physical size of the handset compared to the 6.2-inch Galaxy S9 Plus from last year. <br><br>Elsewhere,
                    there are dual-selfie cameras to enable Live Focus photos packed with bokeh-style blur, a new ultra-wide angle camera in the rear-mounted triple-camera, and an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner that works with wet hands. Finally,
                    the new One UI operating system, which is based on Android Pie, is infinitely better than anything from the likes of Huawei, LG or Sony. One UI has been designed from the ground-up to acknowledge that while we all want massive screens
                    on our phones, massive smartphones are really annoying to use, especially one-handed while squished into the train carriage during a morning commute. <br>To solve this headache, One UI shifts all the elements of the user interface that
                    you’ll actually need to tap into the lower-third of the touchscreen where they are within easy reach. Of course, there are some nitpicks with this flagship phone – which we cover extensively in our Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus review, but
                    none of these stop this from becoming our new go-to recommendation for anyone who wants the best Android handset around.

                <p class="card-text" align="left">We really, really like what Huawei has managed to do with the Huawei P30 Pro, and it easily slides into our best Android phones of 2019. It makes an appearance at the expense of the P20 Pro, and builds on everything that made that 2018
                    handset great as well. We're talking internal components that are enough to give it lightning-fast performance (note the Kirin 980 processor and up to 8GB of RAM), as well as a quad-lens camera capable of performing some really impressive
                    tricks – not least a whopping 5x of optical zoom! This being a Huawei phone, the software experience is a long way from being the best in the business. However, the excellent hardware and build quality means that the P30 Pro ends up
                    a long way in credit when everything is considered.

                <p class="card-text" align="left">The OnePlus series continues to go from strength to strength, and while the OnePlus 7T Pro might not be a huge improvement over the OnePlus 7 Pro, it doesn't really matter: the design is gorgeous, you have the fastest chip around (Android-wise)
                    in the Snapdragon 855 Plus, and the software impresses too. It's hard to pick faults in the OnePlus 7T Pro, though that pop-up selfie camera might not be to everyone's taste (it works well, and if it means no notch then it's okay with
                    us). You don't get many configuration choices either, but what there is should suit you if you're looking to buy one. <br>Cameras have sometimes let the OnePlus series down, and while the rear snapper on the OnePlus 7T Pro isn't quite
                    as good as, say, the Pixel phones, it's still capable of getting very decent shots in good light and low light. It's not going to let you down, and offers up to 3x optical zoom. <br>All in all, this is undoubtedly one of the best Android
                    phones so far and we'd have no qualms about recommending it to you – we're even more excited to see what OnePlus is going to do next year with the OnePlus 8.<br></p><hr>

                <p class="card-text" align="left">As the name suggests, the Plus is a larger, more feature-packed take on the standard Note 10, complete with optional 5G. This is a great phone and is one of the finest all-round Android devices we’ve reviewed. It’s powerful, has just about every feature going and doesn’t skimp at all. In terms of negatives, it’s big, it’s expensive and the display, while fantastic, doesn’t have any fancy tech to enable fast refresh rate, unlike the OnePlus 7 Pro. If you want the best of the best, however, there aren’t many superior options out there.
<br>
This brute of a phone has a lovely display, plenty of grunt, huge battery, Qi charging and water resistance, and comes with USB-C buds. There isn’t a whole lot that’s new compared to the S10, but this still stands as the true high-end Samsung phone for the start of 2020.

                <p class="card-text" align="left">The display now refreshes at 90Hz (in certain circumstances and at varying brightness levels) which gives it a much smoother look. It generally makes the whole phone feel snappier and we would like this to become a common feature for many phones.<br>
<br>
Google has added a secondary camera on the back for the first time, pairing a 12-megapixel wide-angle and 16-megapixel telephoto camera. These two sensors work together, improving everything from general picture quality to low-light shooting and zooming. Snaps from this phone are great and the added versatility of the new lens is welcome.<br><br>
One of the big new features this time around is the radar sensor. This lets you interact with the phone through gesture and it powers the face unlock functions. While the facial unlocking is good (and needs to be, as there’s no fingerprint sensor) the gesture stuff is a bit of a gimmick. Aside from stopping alarms with your hand, there’s not much else you can do.
