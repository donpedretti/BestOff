                <h3 class="card-title" align="left"><b>1. X-Yachts Xp 55</b></h3>
                <p class="card-text" align="left">True dual-purpose cruiser-racers are ever harder to find in today’s increasingly segmented sailboat market—which is one reason why our judges were so impressed with the Xp 55 from Denmark’s X-Yachts. This sleek attractive sloop, only recently arrived in the States, offers truly luxurious living accommodations in a performance design that will also make you look good on the racecourse.<br><br>With a finely honed mix of useful cruising features, like a fold-down transom, dinghy garage and a large fold-away teak cockpit table, plus go-fast features like a finely sculpted high-aspect rudder, optional carbon rig and deep lead-ballasted T-bulb keel, this is one boat that will also not send racing crews sprinting for hotel rooms after the trophies are handed out.<br><br>
                    Build quality is top notch. The boat’s foam-cored glass laminate is reinforced with carbon fiber in critical areas and is all set in vacuum-infused epoxy resin and post-cured in an oven. X-Yachts’ trademark super-strong keel grid (which is constructed of carbon fiber in its Xp boats) ensures that the boat’s high-performance keel with cast-iron fin and a lead bulb will stay firmly attached to the hull in a hard grounding. Meanwhile, belowdecks the quality of the joinerywork is superb and immediately sets this elegant craft apart from most other modern production boats. With a wide choice of quality hardwoods, from oak to teak to walnut, and a broad array of fabric options, each owner can dial in a distinctive look.<br></p>

                <p class="card-text" align="left">The fourth and smallest in the Wauquiez line, the new Pilot Saloon 42 is a nicely finished bluewater cruiser that you may also soon be able to find in charter. The Berret-Racoupeau-designed sloop has a moderate displacement and a choice of keel and rudder depth. (Draft ranges from 5ft 5in to 7ft, and there are twin rudders.) Two or three staterooms are available with the master cabin forward, or aft if you so choose—both aft cabins are that well appointed and offer ensuite heads with separate stall showers. Stowage is significant with drawers below the bed and lockers outboard.<br><br>

Because this is a pilothouse design, long windows are installed all around allowing everyone to enjoy lovely views, even when seated. The straight-line galley is opposite the U-shaped raised dinette to starboard, and a double seat on the centerline is an option. Not only does this expand the seating, but it also provides a great handhold when underway. A traditional, forward-facing nav station is located to port and near the companionway for good communications with those in the cockpit.<br><br>

The joinery and finish are exceptional, and the companionway steps are more of a staircase than a ladder. There is a choice of teak or clear oak cabinetry and several fabric options for the U-shaped settee. The cockpit is large and has a centerline drop-leaf table and twin wheels.<br>

                <p class="card-text" align="left">Good things come in small packages. Jeanneau’s new entry-level design is the Sun Odyssey 319, and she’s small but mighty. The French builder wanted to re-enter the small boat market, and the 319 joins two other models in the 30ft Sun Odyssey range. This way, Jeanneau has a boat for new sailors with families as well as old salts wanting to downsize.<br><br>

It’s easy to build a large boat, but real thought must be put into a compact model. Available with two enclosed cabins and a full head, the 319 offers amenities similar to those of her larger sisters. Light pours in via the coachroof and hull portlights, and the ample headroom increases the sense of space. There’s a two-burner stove, refrigeration and a fold-out table that will seat six for dinner. The master stateroom is a V-berth forward with divided double doors. With these doors open, there’s a perception of length and openness you don’t often find on vessels of this size.<br><br>

The cockpit is large with more outside stowage options than most of the boat’s competitors. A single wheel, a rigid vang and an open transom that provides easy access to the water are standard. The side decks are nice and wide with toerails outboard, and there are study handrails atop the cabintrunk to make going forward a snap.<br></p>

                <p class="card-text" align="left">An evolution of Beneteau’s Sense 50, the new Sense 51 boasts a deck layout that works equally on the hook in a Caribbean anchorage or on passage between islands. New features include a double bow roller with a sprit for flying Code O’s or other reaching sails; an optional hardtop with an opening center section for getting in and out of the sun and rain; an aft galley behind the twin helm seats; and a closed-in cockpit configuration that provides greater security underway while still allowing easy access to the drop-down swim platform. The overall look is both very modern and very French, with blunt ends, chines aft and a wedge-shaped cabintrunk—all nicely executed.<br></p>

                <h3 class="card-title" align="left"><b>5. J/121</b></h3>
                <p class="card-text" align="left">The people at J/Boats are obviously good designers and boatbuilders. Their record in this area stands for itself. However, ever since the advent of Rod Johnstone’s iconic J/24, they have also shown an uncanny ability to discern what exactly it is sailors are looking for in their next boat: think the J/105 and its then cutting-edge retracting bowsprit, or the phenomenon that is the J/70 sport boat. The latest in this long line of outside-the-box designs is the new 40ft J/121, a boat specifically tailored to appeal to skippers who are 1) tired of having to round up eight to 10 people to go racing and 2) are looking for something other the usual windward-leeward “sausage” courses that now dominate inshore racing.<br><br>

To this end the boat carries a “five-sail” rig that includes a main, jib and removable staysail, a la the IMOCA 60 class, to make shifting gears with a crew of as little as five a snap, whether sailing inshore or off soundings. (A Code 0 or A-sail—sails #4 and 5—can be flown off the boat’s retractable sprit.) To keep the boat on its feet, designer Al Johnstone has also included an easy-to-use water ballast system that can shift 104gal from side to side—the equivalent of four bodies worth of rail meat that’ll never call in sick or have scheduling conflicts.<br><br>

With respect to courses, J/Boats is promoting something called “Open Course” racing, middle distance events that offer the best of both inshore and distance events (think the Famous Three-Bridge Fiasco regatta on San Francisco Bay). The boat would also be perfect for shorthanded offshore racing, whether it be a shorter event like the Ida Lewis distance race or the Marblehead-Halifax. Oh, and did we mention the boat sails like a witch and is a stunner to boot? A winner in every sense of the word.
